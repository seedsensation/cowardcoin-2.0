## About the Project
This was a little something I made for my friends a while ago, but the way I had it formatted made the code absolutely indecipherable, with every command from the same file, and cross referencing every single message with every possible command.
I'm hopefully using some better practices this time - I have all the commands in their own file with a directory file so only one file needs to be imported.
This also means that Git is easier to use - I can now use multiple branches at the same time instead of just One because all of the changes will be to independent files and not the core one :)
It's still not going to be ideal because I'm still new to working with actual practices and not piling everything into one file - but this is a good way for me to dip my toes more into the water of development. :D
